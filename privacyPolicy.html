                <p>
                    Jim Lewis Skoglund built the Hitch app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Jim Lewis Skoglund at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service. If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Hitch unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy. Information Collection and Use For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to
                    Phonenumber, E-mail, Name, geo position. The information that I request will be retained on your device and the database service and is not collected by outside the ecosystem in any way. The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app
                </p>

                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – therefore, you should be sure that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're <b>not</b> allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Jim Lewis Skoglund. The app is for personal use only.
                <br />
                <br />
                Jim Lewis Skoglund is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for. The Hitch app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the Hitch app won't work properly or at all. The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

                <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data.

                <h2>Cookies</h2>

                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

                <h2>Service Providers</h2>

                I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                    <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                </ul>

                I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                <h2>Security</h2>

                <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

                This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.
