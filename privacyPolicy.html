            <h1><u>Privacy Policy</u></h1>
            <p>
                Jim Lewis Skoglund built the Hitch app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Jim Lewis Skoglund at
                no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with
                the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use our Service.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to
                this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
                We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                <br />
                <br />
                The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are
                accessible at Hitch unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
            By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – therefore, you should be sure
            that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of
            the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're <b>not</b> allowed to attempt to extract the source code of
            the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions.
            The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to Jim Lewis Skoglund. The app is for personal use only.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jim Lewis Skoglund is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
            reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
            any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
            what you're paying for. The Hitch app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to
            provide my Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
            recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
            restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
            phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it
            could mean that the Hitch app won't work properly or at all.


            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

            For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information, including but not limited to your phone number, email, name, and geographical
            position. This information is crucial to facilitate the core service of our app, aiding users in connecting
            with each other based on their locations.
            <br />
            <br />
            The information that we request will be retained on your device and in our database service and will not be
            collected by entities outside our ecosystem in any way. Additionally, the app utilizes third-party services
            for specific functions, which may collect information used to identify you. You can refer to the privacy
            policy of these third-party service providers for more details.


            <h3>Collection of Geographical Position</h3>

            The Hitch app may collect and utilize your geographical position to enhance the functionality of our
            service. By providing this information, you enable the app to connect you with other users in your vicinity,
            facilitating seamless communication and interaction. Rest assured, we prioritize the security and
            confidentiality of your data, utilizing it solely for the intended purpose of enhancing your user experience
            within the app.

            <h3>Log Data</h3>


            <p>Whenever you use our Service, in the event of an error, we may collect data and information (through
                third-party products) on your device known as Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as
                your device's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, app
                configuration, and usage statistics. This data is collected for debugging purposes and developer usage
                only.</p>


            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These
            are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
            libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
            either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
            refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.


            <h2>Third-party services</h2>

            I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>

            I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information.
            The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
            The app does use third-party services that
            declare their Terms and Conditions.

            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
                method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
            that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review
            the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
            privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

            Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that a child under 13 has
            provided us with personal information, we take immediate steps to delete it from our servers.
